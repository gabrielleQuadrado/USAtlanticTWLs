'_SWLresiduals.mat' files
Residual time series vectors. The residual component corresponds to the difference between the measured and
the reconstructed SWL time series. Each file contains two double arrays: 'residualData' containing the
magnitude of the SWL residual in meters; 'residualTime' containing the time in serial date number format. 
The folder contains 10 files, one for each location.

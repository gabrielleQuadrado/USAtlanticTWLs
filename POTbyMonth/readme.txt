magnitude folder
12x1 vector with the average magnitude of POT TWL events by month. Row numbers 
represent calendar numbers (e.g. row 1 = January, row 12 = December). Folder contains ten files,
one for each location. Data are used to make Figure 4.

numberEvents folder
12x1 vector with the number of POT TWL events occurring on each month. Row numbers 
represent calendar numbers (e.g. row 1 = January, row 12 = December). Folder contains ten files,
one for each location. Data are used to make Figure 4.

relativeContribution folder
12x7 matrix with the average relative contribution to POT TWL events by month. Row 
numbers represent calendar numbers (e.g. row 1 = January, row 12 = December). Columns represent
hydrodynamic contributors to TWLs, in which 1 = mean sea level, 2 = astronomical tides, 3 = 
seasonality, 4 = sea level anomalies, 5 = storm surge, 6 = residual, and 7 = wave runup. Folder
contains ten files, one for each location. Data are used to make Figure 6.

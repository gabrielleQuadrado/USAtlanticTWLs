magnitude folder
1x1 structure with 5 fields (10x1 vectors) with statistics related to the average magnitude of
the TWL and its contributors during seasonal maxima events. Each field is calculated based on all seasonal 
maximum events for each location. Field = 1 mean, field 2 = median, field 3 = maximum, field 4 = minimum,
 field 5 = standard deviation. Vector rows represent 1 = TWL, 2 = SWL, 3 = mean sea level, 4 = sea level 
anomalies, 5 = astronomical tides, 6 = seasonality, 7 = storm surge, 8 = wave runup, 9 = significant wave
height, 10 = peak wave period. The folder contains two subfolders, one for each storm season (extratropical
and tropical season). Subfolders contain ten files, one for each location. Data are used to make Figure 7. 

relativeContribution folder
1x1 structure with 5 fields (10x1 vectors) with statistics related to the average relative contribution to
seasonal maxima TWL events. Each field is calculated based on all seasonal maximum events for each location.
Field = 1 mean, field 2 = median, field 3 = maximum, field 4 = minimum, field 5 = standard deviation. Vector rows
represent hydrodynamic contributors to TWLs, in which 1 = mean sea level, 2 = astronomical tides, 3 = 
seasonality, 4 = sea level anomalies, 5 = storm surge, 6 = residual, and 7 = wave runup. Folder
contains ten files, one for each location. Data are used to make Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information 
document. The folder contains three subfolders: 'runup_nonuniformBeta' relative to TWLs estimated using wave runup
as the wave-induced component and a locally-averaged beach slope; 'runup_uniformBeta' relative to TWLs estimated
using wave runup as the wave-induced component and a uniform beach slope (beta = 0.05); 'setup' relative to TWLs
estimated using wave setup as the wave-induced component and a uniform beach slope (beta = 0.05). Each subfolder
contains two sub-subfolders, one for each storm season (extratropical and tropical season). Sub-subfolders contain
ten files, one for each location.

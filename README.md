# Assessing Total Water Level Drivers - Data Release
Data release to the paper "The Timing, Magnitude, and Relative Composition of Annual Maximum Total Water Levels Vary Seasonally along the U.S. Atlantic Coast".

The codes and data provided here are used to reproduce the figures on the paper. This data release includes the following : 

1) [Annual Maxima TWL Events](annualMaximaEvents) - data used to make Figure 3b [annualMaximaRelativeContribution_Uniform](annualMaximaRelativeContribution_Uniform folder) of the manuscript and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information document [annualMaximaRelativeContribution_NonUniform](annualMaximaRelativeContribution_NonUniform folder). Both figures display the relative contribution of processes to average and extreme TWLs. 

2) [Annual Maxima TWLs by Month](annualMaximabyMonth) - data used to make Figures 5 and 6 of the manuscript, which show, respectively, the [annualMaximabyMonth/numberEvents](number of annual maxima TWL events) and the [annualMaximabyMonth/magnitude](average magnitude of annual maxima TWLs by month), and the average percent contribution of individual water level components to annual maxima TWLs by month.

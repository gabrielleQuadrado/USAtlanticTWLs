FernandinaBeach/Kiptopeke/SandyHook folders
Each folder contains 6 matfiles with data used to create Figure 9. 

annualMaximaFit_confidenceBounds.mat 
Two double variables with the lower (CI_lower) and upper (CI_upper) confidence bounds for the 
annual maxima GEV fit. 

exceedanceProbabilities.mat
Three double variables with the estimated exceedance probabilities for the annual maxima GEV 
fit (yp), extratropical season fit (yp_et), and tropical season fit (yp_tc). 

GEVparameters.mat
Nine double variables with the estimated GEV parameters for the annual maxima GEV fit (parameter), 
extratropical season fit (parameter_et), and tropical season fit (parameter_tc). The shape parameter
is represented by the letter "k", the scale is represented by the letter "s", and the location is
represented by the letter "m".

returnLevelsempirical.mat 
Three double variables with the empirical return levels for  annual maxima TWLs (sortdata_d),
and seasonal maxima TWLs during the extratropical season (sortdata_d_et), and tropical season 
(sortdata_d_tc). 

returnLevelsmodeled.mat
Three double variables with the modeled return levels for  annual maxima TWLs (retgevind),
and seasonal maxima TWLs during the extratropical season (retgevind_et), and tropical season 
(retgevind_tc). 

returnPeriodsempirical.mat 
Three double variables with the empirical return periods for  annual maxima TWLs (T_all),
and seasonal maxima TWLs during the extratropical season (T_et), and tropical season 
(T_tc).

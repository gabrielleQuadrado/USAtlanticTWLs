tauCoefficient_ET/TC.mat
10x4 matrix with Kendall's rank correlation coefficient tau. Row numbers represent locations
from south to north, in which 1 = Fernandina Beach, FL, and 10 = Sandy Hook, NJ. Columns represent
the conditional pairs, in which 1 = storm surge conditioned on TWL seasonal maxima, 2 = TWL 
conditioned on storm surge seasonal maxima, 3 = significant wave height conditioned on TWL 
seasonal maxima, and 4 = TWL conditioned on significant wave height seasonal maxima. The file 
name ending in "ET" is during the extratropical season, and the file name ending in "TC" is during
the tropical season. Data are used to make Figure 8.

pval_ET/TC.mat
10x4 matrix with the p-values for Kendall's rank correlation coefficient analysis. Row 
numbers represent locations from south to north, in which 1 = Fernandina Beach, FL, and 10 = 
Sandy Hook, NJ. Columns represent the conditional pairs, in which 1 = storm surge conditioned on
TWL seasonal maxima, 2 = TWL conditioned on storm surge seasonal maxima, 3 = significant wave 
height conditioned on TWL seasonal maxima, and 4 = TWL conditioned on significant wave height 
seasonal maxima. The file name ending in "ET" is during the extratropical season, and the file 
name ending in "TC" is during the tropical season.

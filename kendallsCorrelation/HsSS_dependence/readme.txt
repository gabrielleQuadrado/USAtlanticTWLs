tauCoefficient_ET/TC.mat
10x4 matrix with Kendall's rank correlation coefficient tau. Row numbers represent locations
from south to north, where 1 = Fernandina Beach, FL, and 10 = Sandy Hook, NJ. Columns represent
the conditional pairs, where 1 = significant wave height conditioned on storm surge seasonal maxima, and
2 = storm surge conditioned on significant wave height seasonal maxima. The file name ending in 
"ET" is related to the extratropical season, and the file name ending in "TC" is related to
the tropical season. Data are used to make Table S4 in the supporting information.

pval_ET/TC.mat
10x4 matrix with the p-values for Kendall's rank correlation coefficient analysis. Row 
numbers represent locations from south to north, where 1 = Fernandina Beach, FL, and 10 = 
Sandy Hook, NJ. Columns represent the conditional pairs, where 1 = significant wave height conditioned on storm surge seasonal maxima, and 2 = storm surge conditioned on significant wave height seasonal maxima. he file name ending in "ET" is related to the extratropical season, and the file 
name ending in "TC" is related to the tropical season. Data are used to make Table S4 in the supporting information.

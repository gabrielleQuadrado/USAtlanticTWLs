averageConditions folder
1x1 structure with 5 fields (7x1 vectors) with statistics related to the average relative 
contribution to TWL average conditions. Each field is calculated based on all average conditions events for 
each location. Field = 1 mean, field 2 = median, field 3 = maximum, field 4 = minimum, field 5 
= standard deviation. Vector rows represent hydrodynamic contributors to TWLs, in which 1 = mean
sea level, 2 = astronomical tides, 3 = seasonality, 4 = sea level anomalies, 5 = storm surge, 
6 = residual, and 7 = wave runup. Folder contains ten files, one for each location. Data are used 
to make Figure 3a.

coOccurrencePercentage folder
1x6 vector with co-occurrence percentage of TWL and components' annual maxima. Each column 
represents hydrodynamic contributors to TWLs, in which 1 = astronomical tides, 2 = storm surge,
3 = wave runup, 4 = significant wave height, 5 = wave runup and storm surge, and 6 = peak wave period.
Folder contains ten files, one for each location. Data are used to make Figure 4.

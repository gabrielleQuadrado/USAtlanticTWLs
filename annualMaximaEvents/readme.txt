annualMaximaRelativeContribution folders
1x1 structure with 5 fields (7x1 vectors) with statistics related to the average relative contribution 
to annual maxima TWL events. Each field is calculated based on all annual maximum events for 
each location. Field = 1 mean, field 2 = median, field 3 = maximum, field 4 = minimum, field 5 
= standard deviation. Vector rows represent hydrodynamic contributors to TWLs, in which 1 = mean
sea level, 2 = astronomical tides, 3 = seasonality, 4 = sea level anomalies, 5 = storm surge, 
6 = residual, and 7 = wave runup. Each folder contains ten files, one for each location. Data are used to
make Figure 3b (Uniform folder) and Figure S1 (NonUniform folder). 

allStations_annualMaxMagnitude_stats_runup.mat file
1x1 structure with 3 fields (10x5) with statistics related to the average magnitude of the annual 
maximum TWL, still water level (SWL), wave runup (R2%), significant wave height (Hs) and peak
wave period (Tp). Each row represents one location, from south to north, in which 1 = 
Fernandina Beach, FL, and 10 = Sandy Hook, NJ. Each column represents one variable; 1 = TWL,
2 = SWL, 3 = R2%, 4 = Hs, and 5 = Tp. Data are used to make Figure S2 of the Supporting 
Information document.

magnitude folder
1x1 structure with 5 fields (10x1 vectors) with statistics related to the average magnitude of
the TWL and its contributors during POT events during the tropical and extratropical seasons.
Each field is calculated based on all POT events for each location during each season. 
Field = 1 mean, field 2 = median, field 3 = maximum, field 4 = minimum, field 5 = standard deviation. 
Vector rows represent 1 = TWL, 2 = SWL, 3 = mean sea level, 4 = sea level anomalies, 5 = astronomical tides, 
6 = seasonality, 7 = storm surge, 8 = wave runup, 9 = significant wave height, 10 = peak wave period. 
The folder contains two subfolders, one for each storm season (extratropical and tropical season). 
Subfolders contain ten files, one for each location. Data are used to make Figure S2 in the Supporting 
Information document.
